# Elizabeth Raffer Anderson

Hi, I am so glad you are here. In life, it is hard to make time to ask ourselves how we are doing. It is often difficult to see why we continue to engage in the same patterns and dynamics that are no longer serving us. I am here to join you on the journey to feel more wholeness and well-being.

I offer a free 30 minute consultation.

## My Approach

My approach is direct, nurturing and connective. Our relationship is the foundation from which we can begin to do the work. I believe in the capacity to change and to become our best selves. I want this for you and I will work with you to achieve this. I incorporate psychodynamic talk therapy to delve into the origins of trauma and pain while incorporating mindfulness and somatic experiencing to treat the mind (thoughts) and body (symptoms). Additionally, I acknowledge that oppression exists within marginalized communities, thus treating the individual in a social context.

## My Background

I have a B.A. in Women's Studies and an M.A. in Counseling Psychology from Lewis and Clark College. I have been practicing for over 8 years working in a variety of settings, including crisis response, family therapy, child/adolescent play and talk therapy and community mental health with adults. I have received training in Hakomi method which incorporates mindfulness and somatic techniques to treat the body/mind), play therapy, trauma informed care, DBT, CBT and psychopharmacology among others.
